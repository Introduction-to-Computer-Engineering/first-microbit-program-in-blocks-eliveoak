# Multi-Dice Roller


I guess this program was the 3rd or 4th one that I *think* I made, mainly because I feel like every program 
that I create must have a **real** purpose. My first program for the Micro:Bit was a pedometer, but knowing
that I'd never use it made me rewrite to a different issue and so on and so forth. 


### The program itself


This program is practical beyond all else, because of the multitude of tabletop games that I play, in which 
rolling **_all_** the dice is a thing. Essentially press a button to choose the dice, it shows which one,
and rolls. Pin 0 and ground resets.
